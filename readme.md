# Initial Post from Gilles Castel
*[How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)*

You can find Castel's repositories [here](https://github.com/gillescastel), if you're a MacOS/Linux user.

# Set-up
Each file is described in the wiki. If you just need some basic math shortcuts, `latexshortcuts.ahk` is all you need.

The basic configuration for each file is the same:

1. Download the file
2. Change `atom.exe` to your text editor (if necessary).
3. Run the script.
