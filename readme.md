# Initial Post from Gilles Castel
*[How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)*

You can find Castel's repositories [here](https://github.com/gillescastel), if you're a MacOS/Linux user.

# Set-up
Each file is described in the wiki. If you just need some basic math shortcuts, `latexshortcuts.ahk` is all you need.

The basic configuration for each file is the same:

1. Download the file
2. Change `atom.exe` to your text editor (if necessary).
3. Run the script.

# Usage
Ideally, this should be a fluent and fast way to take notes/write mathematical text in LaTeX. (I can't strictly recommend keeping the shortcuts on during non-rushed work because they do promote a few "bad habits," but you do you.)

I've tested everything in class/simulated class (via recorded math lectures) to make sure its functional in real time. It might take a bit of practice to get comfortable with the shortcuts, but it is, overall, effective.
